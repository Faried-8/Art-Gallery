                    <h3>Camille Pissarro's Signature</h3>
                    <p>The painter Camille Pissarro tends to be less well known than many of his contemporaries (such as Monet)
                         but has a unique spot in the art timeline. He worked as both an Impressionist and Neo-Impressionist,
                          as well as influencing now-famous artists such as Cézanne, Van Gogh, and Gauguin.
                           He was the only artist to exhibit at all eight of the Impressionist exhibitions in Paris from 1874 to 1886.</p>

                         The painting is in the permanent collection of the Batliner Collection of the Albertina Museum in Vienna, Austria.
                        It was painted using watercolor and gouache, with the white highlights done in gouache

                    <p> Moore was born in Yorkshire and studied at Leeds School of Art in 1919, after serving in the First World War.
                         In 1921 he won a scholarship to the Royal College in London.
                          He later taught at the Royal College as well as the Chelsea School of Art.
                           From 1940 Moore lived at Perry Green in Hertfordshire, now home to the Henry Moore Foundation.
                            At the 1948 Venice Biennale, Moore won the International Sculpture Award

                    <p>This painting by Monet gave the name to the impressionist style of art.
                        He exhibited it in 1874 in Paris in what became known as the First Impressionist Exhibition.
                        In his review of the exhibition which he titled "Exhibition of Impressionists," the art critic Louis Leroy said:
                        "Wallpaper in its embryonic state is more finished than that seascape."

                    <p>This is the signature of Picasso on his 1903 painting (from his Blue Period) titled "The Absinthe Drinker."
                        Picasso experimented with various shortened versions of his name as his painting signature,
                         including circled initials, before setting on "Pablo Picasso." Today we generally hear him referred to as simply "Picasso."                     
                        His full name was: Pablo, Digo, Jose, Francisco de Paula, Juan Nepomuceno, Maria de los Remedios.
